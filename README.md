# Discord-Bot-for-HINT
Below is our submission, team 25, ie, Pseudocode Harbingers for Hackademic 2020

Hello everyone, what we have below is our humble discord bot called Reso9ce bot.
what we tried to achieve is a fun inhouse bot that will help us moderate, make rules, add roles, and send us fun links. this project help us learn and understand basics of JavaScript and Discord.JS

In future updates we are hoping to add music integration into this bot using youtube searches or youtube links, not unlike Groovy bot.

What the bot can currently do is as follows: 
1. ping command to know if the bot is online
2. Ban command to ban members
3. Kick command to kick members
4. Games and Cyberpunk command to bring up some fun links related to cyberpunk 2077 and other famous games
5. Reactionrole command to set up an embed for reaction roles in our server
6. clear command to delete a certain number of msgs
7. prefix command to see current prefix
8. YT command posts a really interesting youtube video
9. Rules command posts the rules of our server in an embed
10. Help command posts the current commands and hteir use
